# SUMMARY 
We hypothesize that bioelectrical signals can be used as a reliable source to analyze and foresee people's mental states. We focus on using these signals to recognize more specific current and predict next mental states provoked by stimulus. 


First, we recognize the current state of a human with a machine learning algorithm which uses Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). Second, we use Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to recognize specific state and conduct analysis of the data. Third, we aim to forecast a future state reaction when a human is stimulated with an unexpected stimulus. 


The ability to recognize and forecast people's mental states can be helpful for the development of Brain Computer Interfaces and human-machine interaction. It can also be beneficial for phycology, neural marketing, and further development of the brain research field. 
As future work, we plan to expand our EEG dataset and find more meaningful characteristic for neural network training.
